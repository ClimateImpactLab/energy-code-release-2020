# Overview 
Codes in this repo perform two tasks: 
1. Converting the regression coefficients stored in ster files to the `csvv` format that our projection system understands. 
2. Creating the configuration files needed to run a projection. 


# Code contents and run instructions
`1_generate_csvv.do`

1. Prepare a csvv file, which is the file type that our projection system uses to read in regression coefficients. 
  - This is done in the code `1_generate_csvv.do`
