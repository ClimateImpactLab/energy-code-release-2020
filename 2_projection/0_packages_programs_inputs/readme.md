## Overview

- Files in `projection_set_up/` are used in codes that write projection inputs, such as config files and the csvvs. 
- Files in `extract_projection_outputs/` are used in codes that extract projection system outputs (ie convert netcdf outputs from the projection system into the csv files used in post-projection analysis).
