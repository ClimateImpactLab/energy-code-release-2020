Quality checks:

# Check number of directories and files (done)
- 5 spatial resolutions directories
- 2 rcps directories
- 1 ssp directories
- 2 time resolutions * (2 fuels * 2 units * 6 stats + 1 fuel * 1 unit * 6 stats) = 60 files per directory
## results
removed a few extra files generate during testing

# Check completeless of data
## year: verify that files with the following filenames have the corresponding columns (done)
1. "*years_all*" : year_2020 ~ year_2099
2. "*years_averaged*" : years_2020_2039, years_2040_2059, years_2080_2099

## regions: verify that files have correct number of regions (done)

## check for zeros, NAs, Infs in all files (a few concerning NAs)
## check percentage gdp is always <1 (not necessarily true, but found a few weird median files)


# Randomly check that values are extracted and calculated correctly
## check kwh and gj conversion (reversed, need to regenerate)
## check actual values
