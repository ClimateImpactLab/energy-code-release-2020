# extract data for 
# map 2099 damages as percent gdp (SSP2/3/4 x RCP4.5/8.5 x IAM high/low)
# map the 2099 damages as percent gdp separately for electricity and other fuels. (SSP2/3/4 x RCP4.5/8.5 x IAM high/low)
# pick a couple of IRs (2 from among the kernel density IRs that are in different countries would be fine) and plot their electricity/other fuels prices over time, under the tool price scenario and the 1.4% scenario. actually this doesnâ€™t even need to be in a graph. it can just be in a spreadsheet.

# Prepare code release data, and save it on Dropbox...
# Note - all maps in the paper are for 2099, SSP3, rcp85, high, so these are hard coded 
# This code should be run from inside the risingverse-py27 conda environment 
# Extract not for integration, but integration scenario
