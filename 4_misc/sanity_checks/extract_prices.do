* code doing this sanity check:
* pick a couple of IRs (2 from among the kernel density IRs 
* that are in different countries would be fine) and plot 
* their electricity/other fuels prices over time, 
* under the tool price scenario and the 1.4% scenario. 
* actually this doesnâ€™t even need to be in a graph. 
* it can just be in a spreadsheet.

* prices are stored at /shares/gcp/social/baselines/energy
