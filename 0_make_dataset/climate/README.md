# Climate Data Construction

As outlined [here](https://gitlab.com/ClimateImpactLab/Impacts/energy-code-release/blob/master/0_make_dataset/coded_issues/README.md), the IEA dataset documentation describes that some energy load observations are reported on non-gregorian calendars and for non-standard geographic regions. We account for these two types of energy load data features by constructing country x year climate data variables which align with the geographic and temporal definitions baked into each energy load observation. For example:
* In [clean_WORLD.do](https://gitlab.com/ClimateImpactLab/Impacts/energy-code-release/blob/master/0_make_dataset/climate/programs/clean_WORLD.do), we construct yearly Australian climate data with the following definition of year: July t to June t + 1.  
* We use a shapefile for Italy which includes San Marino and the Holy Sea. The shapefile can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/ClimateImpactLab/Impacts/energy-code-release/blob/master/0_make_dataset/climate/programs/clean_ITA_SMR_VAT.do).
