# Climate Data Construction

As outlined [here](https://gitlab.com/ClimateImpactLab/Impacts/energy-code-release/blob/master/0_make_dataset/coded_issues/README.md), documented changes in the definition of a year and a country impact the way we construct climate data. For example:
* AUS - “All data refer to the fiscal year (e.g. July 2014 to June 2015 for 2015).”
