# Dataset construction

We construct four datasets for analysis:
* IEA_merged_long.dta: This is an intermediary dataset including population, energy load, climate, and income data. We clean IEA_merged_long.dta in three different ways to produce regression ready datasets for our main specification and robustbess models.
