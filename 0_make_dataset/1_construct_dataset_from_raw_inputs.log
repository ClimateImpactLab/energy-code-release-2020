> Purpose: Master Do File for Dataset Construction
> 
> This script takes in raw data input files either downloaded from the internet
>  or constructed using merge_transform_average.py
> (https://bitbucket.org/ClimateImpactLab/climate_data_aggregation/src/master/)
> . Please use 0_Clim_Config_Gen.do to write configs
> that are passed into the Climate Data Aggregation code.
> 
> Before this do file is run the following steps need to be completed:
> 
> 1) Load, population, and income data must be extracted.
>         -Please refer to https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Energy-Replication-Dat
> a-Extraction-and-Clean--AcW~Qw9B5VVB29k4PJCYL1I3Ag-VAYyKKRjKXNub5MzctYgB
>         for data extraction instructions.
> 
> 2) Climate Data Must be Generated
>         - Climate Data is generated to reflect geographical regions used in t
> he load data. 
>         See the dropbox paper referenced above as well as the aggregated clim
> ate data cleaning code to understand how the 
>         climate data is generated to reflect load data specific geographic re

> What happens in the do files called in this script:
> 
> Step 1) Construct Population, Income, Load, and Climate Datasets
> Step 2) Merge Population, Income, Load and Climate Datasets
