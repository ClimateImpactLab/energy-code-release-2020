# Impacts visualisation

## Overview 
- Codes in this repo reproduce figures in the paper that are visualisations of projected impacts, in order to show their distribution across space and time. 

## Run instruction
Use `./1_visualise_impacts.sh` to run all scripts in this directory, or refer to it for commands to run each script.


## Code specific notes

### `bar_chart_fig_2B/`
- Run `1_prepare_bar_chart_data.do` to clean data from the projection system outputs and prepare it for plotting. 
- `2_plot_bar_chart.R` takes in the data prepared in `1_prepare_bar_chart_data.do`, and outputs paper Figure 2B. 
- Code inputs:
	- `/<yourDATA>/OUTPUT/projection_system_outputs/covariates/SSP3_IR_level_population.csv`: projected population data
	- `/<yourDATA>/DATA/IEA_Merged_long_GMFD.dta`: historical consumption data from our estimation dataset
	- `/<yourDATA>/OUTPUT/projection_system_outputs/mapping_data/main_model-*-SSP3-rcp85-high-fulladapt-impact_pc-2099-map.csv`: projected impacts per capita at the impact region level for the year 2099.
- Code outputs: 
	- `fig_2B_*_consumption_compared_to_2099_impact_bars.pdf`

### `plot_2010_and_2090_covariate_distributions.R`
- This code outputs the raw materials used to construct Appendix Figure C.3, which shows how the global income and climate covariate sample changes between 2010 and 2090.
- Note - construction of the final version of the figure used in the paper requires assembly using Adobe Illustrator.
- Code inputs:
	- `<yourDATA>/OUTPUT/projection_system_outputs/covariates/covariates-SSP3-rcp85-high-2010_2090-CCSM4.csv`
- Code outputs:

### `plot_city_responses.do`
- This code plots response functions for the Guangzhou and Stockholm, at both their 2015 and 2099 covariate values. This aims to help readers understand how changing income and climate affect our projected response functions. These are presented in the paper as insets within Figure 2A. 
- Code inputs:
	- `<yourDATA>/DATA/miscellaneous/stockholm_guangzhou_covariates_2015_2099.csv`: projected covariates for the two impact regions  (Guangzhou and Stockholm) both in 2015 and in 2099. 
	- `<yourDATA>/DATA/miscellaneous/stockholm_guangzhou_2015_min_max.csv`: min and max values for the two impact regions, to allow us to subset the temperature range over which we show our response functions. 
	- `<yourDATA>/DATA/regression/IEA_Merged_long_GMFD.dta`: historical consumption and income knot point (See Appendix Section C.3) data from our estimation dataset
	- `<yourDATA>/DATA/miscellaneous/stockholm_guangzhou_region_names_key.csv`: a cross walk between the names of our impact regions and strings that refer to Guangzhou and Stockholm

	- `fig_2A_city_response_functions_2015_and_2099.pdf`

### `plot_damages_by_2012_income_decile.R`
- This code shows how the end-of-century energy consumption impacts we project are distributed across present-day income deciles. The output is Figure H.1 in the Appendix.

- Code outputs: 
	- `fig_Extended_Data_fig_4-H1-new_SSP3-high_rcp85-total-energy-price014-damages_by_country_inc_decile.pdf`

### `plot_kernel_density_functions.R`
- This code generates visualisations of the uncertainty around our projected impacts due to climate change for selected impact regions. We do this by taking draws from the distribution of impacts for these impact regions, by loading in the mean and variance of their impacts under each of the 33 climate projections in the SMME for the year 2099. By taking draws from each of these Gaussian distributions in proportion to each GCM's weight (see Appendix Section A.2.3 and Table 1 for more details), we can calculate the mixture distribution across the 33 climate projections for each impact region. See Appendix Section C.5.
- Note - this code sources functions from `0_utils/kernel_densities.R`. 
- The outputs of this code are used in Figure 3A of the paper.
- Code inputs:
	- `/<yourDATA>/OUTPUT/projection_system_outputs/IR_GCM_level_impacts/gcm_damages-main_model-total_energy-SSP3-rcp85-high-fulladapt-price014-2099-select_IRs.csv`: Impacts for selected impact regions in the year 2099, under each of the 33 climate projections in the SMME. 
	- `/<yourDATA>/OUTPUT/projection_system_outputs/covariates/SSP3-high-IR_level-gdppc_pop-2099.csv`: GDP values for the Impact Regions in the year 2099, in order to convert the units of the plots to percent of GDP.
